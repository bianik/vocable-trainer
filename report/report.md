## The program
The for the project chosen program is a vocable trainer, which can be used for learning vocables in another language by repetitively checking the vocables. The vocables are added to the application providing a phrase in the language to learn and it's translation in the mother tongue. After adding the vocables they can be learned by calling a vocable's translation and entering the corresponding phrase. The given answer will be checked with the phrase of the earlier added vocable and the result will be shown providing information about whether the phrase was correct or incorrect along with the number of correct tries, overall tries and a percentile ratio. After that the next vocable can be checked provided in the order the vocables have been added earlier, starting and also continuing with the first one after checking the last vocable. A new vocable can be added at any time.
The application can be run with a command line interface or a graphical user interface, depending on an argument given on start up along with some other arguments for internal settings.
